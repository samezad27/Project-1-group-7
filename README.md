# CarryOn

## Description
This application  can tell the user what to pack based on the user's input of travel destination, dates, and a few other important pieces of information. Often times, we tend to overpack or even underpack when traveling to new places. Packing a carry on luggage can be tough, therefore this application makes it simple and provide the user the essentials that will fit in their bag and service the needs of their trip. Based on the user's input, the application will give a list of items that will let users know what to bring based on the occasion of the trip, as well as typical items needed to bring on a trip.
